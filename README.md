## üìã Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a laptop based on its specifications and features. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project helps users make informed purchasing decisions.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to predict laptop prices.
- Utilize data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data.
- Explore and visualize data to identify key features influencing laptop prices.
- Evaluate the performance of different regression algorithms.

## üìä Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes various features of laptops, such as:

- **Brand**: The manufacturer of the laptop.
- **RAM**: The amount of Random Access Memory in GB.
- **Storage**: The storage capacity and type (HDD/SSD).
- **Processor Type**: The type and model of the processor.
- **Screen Size**: The size of the display.
- **Graphics**: Information about the graphics card.
- **Price**: The target variable representing the price of the laptop.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data.
   - Normalize and scale the features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize data to identify correlations and important features.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## üìà Results

- The **Random Forest Regression** model achieved the best performance with an R-squared value of 0.85 and an MAE of 200 USD.
- Key factors influencing laptop prices were identified as **Processor Type**, **Brand**, and **RAM Size**.
